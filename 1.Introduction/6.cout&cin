/*
Enter the num1:10.55 => Entered 10.55
Enter the num2:=> promt will not hold here
The num1 is 10 and num2 is 10.55

Here what happens is that a buffer is created and it stores
 10 first and allocates to num1 and then when it tries to
read a double type number it finds it in the console i.e 0.55
therefore it does not stop the promt and prints it .
*/

/*
Enter the num1:10.a => Entered 10.a
Enter the num2: Promt will not hold here
 The num1 is 10 and num2 is 0.
=> it creates a buffer and saves 10.a and now
 read comes for num1 , it reads 10 and go to
  next step . Here it is expecting double integer
  which it got as ".a" which is not double. There
fore it saves 0 as default value
